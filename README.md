# Predictive-Analytics-for-Heart-Failure
Identifying the risk factors early and taking preventive measures can help reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease and related complications. 
An interactive web application is built using R Studio and the Shiny package. This shiny app is deployed on shinyapps.io and it could be accessed by clicking the below link. Application Link:  https://kirankumartm.shinyapps.io/Health
While the logistic regression algorithm used in this predictive model can provide useful insights into the likelihood of an individual having heart disease, it is important to keep in mind that the model's predictions may not always be accurate and correct. 
Additionally, since the dataset used to build the model contains only 303 observations, there are limitations to the model's prediction capabilities. However, there is potential to enhance the accuracy of the tool's predictions by employing more advanced Machine Learning algorithms and utilizing a more complex dataset with more variables to create a more sophisticated predictive model.

**Note:**
Sometimes, only sometimes, when accessing the app through the application link, there may be issues such as 0 or 100% probability being displayed. Strangely, this issue only seems to occur when accessing the app through the application link or shinyapps.io. However, if the app is opened through R Studio, this issue does not appear at all. If you encounter this issue, try opening the app through the link again after sometime or you can try running the code (in app.R file) directly through R Studio.
